# Javascript Projects
A collection of projects using vanilla JavaScript that I have built. 

---------------------

These apps are categorized into 3 levels of difficulty:

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

I will update this repo as I complete these apps.

These are Javascript apps based on user stories found at: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas
