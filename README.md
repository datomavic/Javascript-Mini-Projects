# Javascript Mini Projects
 A bunch of mini projects using vanilla JavaScript. 

 This is a collection of Javascript apps based on user stories found at: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas

 These app ideas are categorized into 3 levels of difficulty:

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

I will update this repo as I complete these apps.
