# GitHubStatus

This app will check and display the current status of GitHub and all of its components.

The app accomplishes this via a Fetch API found at https://www.githubstatus.com/api using this <a href=https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/summary.json>JSON</a> object.

It will also display the date and time that the Fetch API was last updated.
